# Heart Disease Recognition Model

## Introduction
This repository contains a Python-based machine learning model for recognizing heart disease. The model is trained on a dataset of patients with various health metrics and uses this data to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, sklearn, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras

### Installation
1. Clone the repo: `https://github.com/Bubu02/Heart_Disease_Recognition_Model/tree/0de0d3f26503d203878c677020017cba09c65906`
2. Install Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
This project contains a Jupyter notebook that walks through the process of reading the data, exploring it, selecting features, normalizing the data, splitting it into training and test sets, selecting the model, training the model, and finally testing the model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is `heart.csv`, which contains various health metrics for a number of patients, along with a target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

## Model
Several models are evaluated using GridSearchCV, including SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Neighbours Classifier. The best model is selected based on the score from the GridSearchCV.

## Contributing
Instructions on how to contribute to the project.
